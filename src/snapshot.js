/**
 * The one JSON the browser ever reads.
 *
 * Pure on purpose: given a round's outcome, the current settings and the
 * poller's own state, the snapshot is a function — no clock, no I/O, no cache.
 * That is what lets the rules below be tested instead of hoped for.
 *
 * Three outcomes must not be conflated:
 *
 * - **a round succeeded** — new rows, `stale: false`, and `polledAt` moves;
 * - **a round is in flight (or settings changed)** — keep showing what we have,
 *   `failed: false`. Marking this stale would make the panel claim its numbers
 *   may be wrong every time the user toggles a checkbox;
 * - **a round failed** — keep the last good rows and set `stale: true`, because
 *   wiping ten correct rows over a transient hiccup is the worse answer.
