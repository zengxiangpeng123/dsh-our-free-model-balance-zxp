/**
 * Calling the official Our Free Model plugin from inside the kernel.
 *
 * OFM deliberately locks its management surface behind browser authentication:
 * `/api/channel-pack` is registered as an exact Fetch route on the kernel's
 * `connection` service, and an HTTP request from outside the app is answered
 * 401. A plugin running in the same process may call it — by handing that route
 * a copy of the shared owner Peer and posting the kernel's own RPC envelope.
 *
 * Two shapes differ across kernel versions and must not be confused:
 *
 * - The owner Peer is `connection.browserPeer` from DSH 0.2.1 on, and
 *   `connection.operator` before that. They are the same identity under two
 *   names; each version only ever understands its own.
 * - The route answers with the handler result wrapped in an `rpcId`-keyed
 *   envelope, so the payload is `body.result ?? body`.
 *
 * Reading only one of the two Peer names is what made a sibling plugin report
 * "no owner peer" on every 0.2.0 install, so both are accepted here.
