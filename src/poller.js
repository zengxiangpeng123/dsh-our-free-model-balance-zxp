/**
 * Who polls, and when.
 *
 * Two rules keep this honest.
 *
 * **The timer owns the interval; the heartbeat owns "is anyone looking".** A
 * heartbeat while the timer is running must not refresh on its own — otherwise
 * every open tab becomes a second scheduler and the configured interval means
 * nothing. It refreshes only when what it would show has gone older than
 * `max(idle timeout, interval)`: shorter than the interval polls more often than
 * asked, longer than the idle timeout leaves a returning user reading numbers
 * the poller itself had given up on.
 *
 * **A stopped poller restarts on the next watch, unconditionally.** That is a
 * different branch: once nothing has been watching for the idle timeout the
 * timer is gone, so a watch is the only event that can bring it back. Treating
 * it like the normal path (which would require the data to be stale by
 * `max(ttl, interval)`) leaves the poller dead until then — and with a long
 * interval, that can be minutes of a frozen chip.
 *
 * Everything here takes its clock, its timers and its round-fetcher from the
 * caller, so the whole state machine is testable without waiting on wall time.
